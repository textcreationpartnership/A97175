            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your Son, Daughter, and Grandchild are well, and Mr. <hi>Hewet</hi> is in this Town at this time. For newes here is ſo much I know not how to relate it. We are well here yet (thanks be to God) though daily threatned: and our Souldiers have done many exploits againſt the Rebels.</p>

            <p> They have taken by force, <hi>Downdanel</hi> which was before you went, and <hi>Montane</hi> Caſtle, which they burnt, and killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men. The next was <hi>Cargenas,</hi> where <hi>Kingſale</hi> Troope and <hi>Bandon</hi> met with Ordnance, and ſhot a whole day, and made many ſmall breaches, but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; there were two men killed, but none of the Souldiers: They came home that night and lef<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next day they met againe and ſhot till noone, and they no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> yeelding, our Souldiers fired the Caſtle, and leaving a Guard the ſecond night, they came home; and going the third day there was a great cry of men, women, and children from the top of the Caſtle, for mercy; our Souldiers gave them the beſt aſſiſtance they could to help them downe, but they were ſo ſcorched with the fire, that they hanged and ſtifled one another, before they could be helpt.</p>
            <p>The next day they marched untill they came to <hi>Pollalong,</hi> where after a while
<pb facs="tcp:172985:3"/>they had plyed them with ſhot, they yeelded on quarter to Captaine <hi>Aderly,</hi> upon condition to be guarded to <hi>Kilcre,</hi> where Captain <hi>Copar</hi> guarded them.</p>
            <p>There was M. <hi>Roch</hi> and his Wife of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi> and his ſonnes and daughters, and many other Gentlemen and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They of the Caſtle told Captaine <hi>Copar,</hi> that the pillage was worth twelve thouſad pouds.</p>
            <p>Afterwards our Souldiers went to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady Bog,</hi> wher the Rebels had built Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and ſtood upon their guard, they were a hundred and well armed, but there was ſmall fighting before the Rebels ran away, our men killed between 30. or 40. and one was their Captaine, whoſe horſe they brought to Towne with a great Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, with 4. more.</p>
            <p>There was a great fight neer <hi>Cork</hi> with my Lord Preſidents Forces againſt my L. <hi>Muskrey,</hi> where they killed about 100. men and Captain <hi>Suggan</hi> on our ſide loſt none but one horſe killed with a ſhot.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the L. <hi>Jnchiquin</hi> was ſet on by the
<pb facs="tcp:172985:4"/>Lord <hi>Roches</hi> and <hi>Caudens</hi> ableſt Forces, hard by the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> Caſtle, called <hi>Caſtletown:</hi> but it pleaſed God to bring the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> off, and his company without any loſſe, onely one Horſe; but there were ſlain of the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> men about an hundred and forty, the reſt they forced into the Caſtle, burnt the outward gate, recovered two Drums, two Cullars, and ſome fiftie Muskets. And afterwards, the Lord <hi>Jnchiquin</hi> and Maſter <hi>Jepſon</hi> burnt and waſted all the Lord <hi>Roches,</hi> and <hi>Caudens</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> reported, that whileſt he lay for his paſſage, our Forces have taken in <hi>Kill-Britain,</hi> and chaſed the Rebels from thence, having ſlain many of them; inſomuch that we may now travaile to <hi>Corke</hi> or <hi>Kinſale</hi> unmoleſted, and not once ſee a Rebell.</p>
            <p>We hope in the Lord, that (through the undanted courage and reſolutions of our Souldiers, who in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeem not in the leaſt diſmaid) this Country wil be ſoon ſetled in a quiet and
<pb facs="tcp:172985:4"/>peaceable and quiet eſtate. <hi>Limmerick</hi> men have built two Block-houſes upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and placed Ordance in each, the one at <hi>Cortebarck</hi> on <hi>Munſter</hi> ſide, the other on <hi>Thomond</hi> ſide, and chained up the River between, as it is credibly reported: there is Captain <hi>Coles</hi> ſhip and one more now in the River, but the newes is they cannot relieve the City.</p>
